Your grandparents' retirement savings now buy less than half of what they once did. This isn't economics—it's generational theft.",

Bitcoin's fixed at 21 million—scarce like gold, but digital. <strong>Prosperity:</strong> Fiat concentrates wealth among elites. Bitcoin rewards proof of work, enabling global economic mobility.",
