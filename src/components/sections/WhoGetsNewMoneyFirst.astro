          New money reaches banks, corporations, and government first — they spend it before prices rise. 
          By the time it trickles down to you through wages or benefits, everything already costs more. 
          This is the Cantillon Effect: those closest to the money printer benefit, while those furthest 
          away lose purchasing power. Your savings are silently eroded as new money flows to the top first.

        <p>
          New money reaches banks, corporations, and government first. They spend it before prices rise, 
          purchasing assets, real estate, and goods at current market rates. By the time this new money 
          trickles down to you through wages or benefits, everything already costs more.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the Cantillon Effect in action. Named after 18th-century economist Richard Cantillon, 
          it describes how money creation benefits those closest to the source of new money, while those 
          furthest away bear the brunt of inflation. The closer you are to the money printer, the more 
          purchasing power you maintain. The further away, the more you lose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Banks get first access through loans and credit creation. Corporations receive it through 
          government contracts and favorable financing. Government agencies spend it on programs and 
          infrastructure. By the time it reaches working families, the damage is done. Your savings 
          have been silently eroded, and your purchasing power diminished.
