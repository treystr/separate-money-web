# You're Not Crazy — Life Is Getting Harder

You work longer hours than your parents did, yet housing, education, healthcare, and even groceries feel further out of reach. You're not imagining it, and you're not alone. Something fundamental has changed.

## The Reality We Face

The statistics tell a story that many of us feel in our daily lives:

- **Housing costs** have skyrocketed relative to income
- **Education expenses** have become a burden for generations
- **Healthcare costs** continue to rise unpredictably
- **Basic necessities** consume a larger portion of our earnings

## What Changed?

Something shifted in the economic landscape. The rules of the game changed, and many of us are playing by an outdated playbook. The middle class is shrinking, and the gap between what we earn and what things cost continues to widen.

## You're Not Alone

This isn't a personal failing. This isn't about working harder or making better choices. This is about understanding the system we're operating within and recognizing that the deck has been stacked in ways that aren't immediately obvious.

## The Path Forward

Understanding what happened is the first step toward finding solutions. By examining the root causes, we can begin to see how to protect ourselves and build a better future.
