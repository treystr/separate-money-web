    "content": "<strong>Since 1971, when Nixon severed the dollar from gold, your purchasing power has been silently stolen.</strong> Every dollar you save loses value through inflation—government's hidden tax that hits working families hardest. Remember when a house cost $25,000? A college education was affordable? That was before the money printer ran wild. Now, your grandparents' retirement savings buy less than half of what they once did. This isn't economics—it's generational theft.",

Housing became unaffordable. Young people remain trapped at home into their 30s. Wealth inequality reached record highs while wage growth stagnated. This wasn't accidental—it was the cost of fiat's Triffin Dilemma, where global power demands domestic sacrifice. We inherited this broken system, but we don't have to perpetuate it.",
